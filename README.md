# AI-Powered Social Media App (Backend)

A backend system for a full-stack social media platform inspired by Instagram and Twitter — but with a twist: powerful AI integrations! Built with real-time features, scalable architecture, and smart AI-driven content generation.

##  Tech Stack
   

- Node.js & **Express.js** – Server-side development
- MongoDB – Database for users, posts, comments, chats
- Redis – Caching layer to boost performance
- Socket.io – Real-time communication (chat & notifications)
- Google Gemini 1.5 Flash – AI-based captions & hashtags generation
- **Cloudinary** – Cloud image and video management for media uploads
- Postman – API testing and documentation

## 🔧 Core Features
      

- ✅ **User Authentication** (Register, Login, Logout) with JWT tokens
- ✅ **Post Management** (Create, Like, Unlike, Comment, Reply)
- ✅ **AI-Generated Captions & Hashtags** (Google Gemini API)

## 👨‍💻 About This Project
     

This is a personal passion project — not a tutorial or assignment.  
It represents real problem-solving, backend system design, and integrating AI technologies practically.

Through this project, I strengthened my belief that:  
"Given an idea, I can break it down, design it, and bring it to life through code."
