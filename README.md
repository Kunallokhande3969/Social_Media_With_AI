## 👨‍💻 About This Project

This is a **personal passion project**, not a tutorial or assignment.  
It represents real problem-solving, backend system design, and integrating AI technologies practically.

Through this project, I strengthened my belief that:  
"Given an idea, I can break it down, design it, and bring it to life through code."
